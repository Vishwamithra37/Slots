   a) add resource type.
   b) Give the details of the resource type. (Description) 
   c) give the dates - All year, everyday, every week etc etc. And division of slots. (He may also want to limit the time the slots are open. Make it as flexible as possible). And number of people who an book the slot. And option for metadata (which may contain specific information such as location, numbers, ids etc).
   d) Assign users (Either by bulk or by groups) to the resource.

Main Features:

--> Need to be generic such that it can be used for any slot booking purposes. (where the users need to assign a resource to someone)
--> Mail notifications.
--> Neat code structure and maintainable.
--> Open Source.

Steps:

Create a blueprint flask structure with all the colloborator names.
Integrate them all with a common main.py where all the blueprint routes will be used.

***Use branches to make sure your commits aren't overwritten or synchronization messes up the code.***
